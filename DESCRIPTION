Description: pfrefscrape pulls scrimmage and passing stats from Pro Football 
  Reference and stores them in a data table. All functions take an
  argument for the desired seasons and the format yearA:yearB is recommended.
  ProBowl and AllPro variables within passing data will only apply to QBs, 
  skill players that recorded passing stats and made honours as a different 
  position won't show True for said variables. Player data has periods ('.'), 
  Jr., Sr. etc. removed for easy manipulation. 
  Scrimmage data includes nflfastR's positional and team name data as 
  alternative to pfref values. Additionally, scrimmage data includes the 
  following variables: opportunities, fantasy points and first down rate.
